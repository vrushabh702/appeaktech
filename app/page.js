                  <Accordion.Body>
                    The type of technology to use differs from project to
                    project and the objective of the website for which it is
                    developed. If it is a normal information awareness website
                    then a normal CMS system like WordPress will be effective.
                    If you aim for an e-commerce website then the use of
                    Magento, WooCommerce, Joomla, drupal, and more is
                    recommended. Custom web applications can use Mean and Mern
                    stack. For mobile applications use of Swift, kotlin, flutter
                    and React Native is suitable. Feel free to contact us to
                    know which technology suits best your specific project
                    needs.
